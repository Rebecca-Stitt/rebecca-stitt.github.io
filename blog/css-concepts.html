    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2></div>

    <div>
    <p>First of all, imagine a house. There is a fence around the house. The fence is called a <em>Border</em> and is what goes <em>around</em> an element. The house is the <em>element</em>. To dictate what the house touches, or if it touches anything at all, we use a <em>margin</em> and <em>padding.</em> Padding controls the space inside a border, while the margin controls the space around the outside the border.  We can think about the padding being the space inside the house’s boundary (the element), and the margin being anything outside your house’s boundary (i.e the footpath outside your property, or a neighbouring house)</p>
    <p>The larger the padding, the more space between an element. In the house case, if we have a large amount of padding, there is a large amount of space between our house, and our fence. If there was no padding, the house would be literally touching the fence. The larger the margin, the more distanced it will be to different objects or elements. In this case, if there was a large margin, your fence will not be in contact with any other fences any time soon. However if there was no margin, it is likely your fence and your neighbours fence would be touching.
</p>
    <p>It can be confusing to remember the two terms at first, and which is which. I found rhyme helps me remember things so came up with the following which may help you too. Think of Paddington bear wanting to remain curled up tight resting against all the <em>insides</em> of a nice safe warm honey pot. Padding = <strong>inside</strong> And marge simpson marching angrily <em>outside </em> her house. Margin = <strong>outside</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Some other tips:</h2>
    <p>The margin can be a negative, or float number. The padding does not allow for negative values.</p>
       
    <p>You can increase/use a margin when you have two or more elements, and you don’t want them to touch. </p>
    
    <p>You can use/increase padding when you have an element but you don’t want the text or image inside it to touch the border. You can also use it to do a resize of something, i.e a button.

<p>Here are some screenshots to help you also</p>

<p>We have 4 devs, we have a red border to make it easy to see where the padding and margin is</p>

<p>Now lets change the padding and margin, and see what happens</p>

<p>We can see that the boxes are no longer touching, as we have increased the margins. </p>
