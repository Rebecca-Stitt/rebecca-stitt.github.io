        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths </h1>
        <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
          <p>In a previous job, I was working in a group setting, with 6 others. There was a total budget for everyone’s pay. Two of us had been there a little longer, so had more responsibilities and experience and so had a higher pay. This was a small creative project, and it came to the director’s realisation that there was not enough in the salary budget to have everyone involved in the next project. Myself, the director, and the other person who had been there longer discussed this together. My values of working in a loyal and dedicated team, and appreciating everyone’s different values and strengths, meant I really struggled with the idea of the team being reduced down to 6. One the one hand, we could have more creative people to work with, and have more hands on decks, but with a pay decrease. The other, less in our creative pool, a better salary, but also a possibility of spreading people thin. We came to the conclusion that the 3 of us would take a pay cut, and offer to the other members of the team no increase in pay for the year. I reflect on it now, and ultimately am glad with the choice. There were unseen benefits of having our full crew, and I guess for me I value people over money.

          <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>My family is pretty wonderfully blue-colar, and I’m very proud of them. My Dad worked as a mechanic and still works helping to fix cars, and my Mum worked two jobs - one in a post-office which later became the local post-bank where I grew up, and the other as a teller at horse-racing events. Although busy with work, both were always very involved in my brothers’ and my hobbies. They always put the importance of working hard with people that you enjoy, but to make time for others. They worked hard, but it was only to give their family a comfortable life. I think ultimately their views of work, and about prioritising others, have shaped me. I value others, basically caring about people and animals more than anything. My identity has always been as a helper or as a supportive person.

        <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
        </h2>
        <p>Using the VIA institute of character test, my strengths are:
          Social Intelligence, teamwork, and creativity.
          I think this plays well for working with others especially if we are all working with a shared end-goal. I can pick up if someone is having a hard time and can help (I need to remember to do the same for myself). Creativity is necessary for everything, including everything in the course. It helps to trouble-shoot, and to look at things with a different perspective.
          </p>
          <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          </h2>
          <p>My limitations are: I am a slow learner, this will likely get worse with age, and I struggle to grasp concepts when first given to me. I also constantly compare myself to others. I become demotivated or frustrated or fall into a downward spiral when I am not as good as someone at something. It also makes me question my capabilities.  This sometimes means I will try to jump ahead of something when I am lagging, just to complete a task or challenge; but it does not mean I have absorbed the information. I also panic, and fall into pits of anxiety which does not help anyone or anything. In order to stop this I need to keep to the challenge task timetable, but make sure to allocate myself a small amount of extra time each day to relearn concepts. I need to keep asking myself how confident I would be at teaching someone else the material.

<h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
</h2>
<p>I was working a shared reception job with another person at a hospital during covid. It was extremely busy, and we were short staffed. We were down a health-care assistant for an extended but unspecified period of time. The Doctors complained about certain protocols not being followed - these were part of the health-care-assistant role. The two of us at reception understood the stress everyone was under, so started doing some of the roles the health-care-assistant would do. 
  We were then stretched. I voiced to my colleague that we shouldn’t be doing the other role, as we were then getting behind in our actual reception duties. She voiced that the Drs were getting frustrated and annoyed, which effected patients, so we should try and just do it, and come in a little earlier/finish later to do it (we were not paid the additional time until a few weeks later once we brought this up). We were both valid in our thoughts, but it was conflicting. The understaffing went on for around 2 months.
  My strategies I tried: Just doing the additional role. This was not good. It added to the stress and workload of my role. My performance of my main duties slipped, and ultimately it didn’t solve the main problem: that we needed an extra staff member. I became resentful of my colleague for telling the Doctors that we would do the role, but I didn’t clearly or fairly bring this up to her. This was bad communication on my part, as well as not voicing when I felt uncomfortable.
  I tried not doing the role and communicating that with the Drs and my colleague that I was not going to be doing the additional role. This was fine, until my colleague was sick. It meant I had to do the role, as well as try to teach it to the person covering her, and do my own reception duties. This lead to overwork. I had only communicated with the Drs and my colleague about this - no one else. Because of the lack of communication to those higher up, it was not clear of an exact chain of command or process.
  I would next time communicate more, and not just to my workmates, and would communicate straight away. I would email someone from higher up, and ask for them to reply to me along with everyone in the department. I would then ask for feedback from the drs and my workmate, and discuss together what the best outcome could be. With discussing everything together, it would mean frustrations would be aimed at the situation, and not at work colleagues. Basically it comes down to better communication. It also goes against my nature to speak up or give input, but I would work harder at this next time,  and would work on not feeling intimidated, embarrassed, or nervous to do so.
