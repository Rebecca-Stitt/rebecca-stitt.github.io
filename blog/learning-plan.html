<h2>
  What is your long term goal or career pathway?
</h2>
<p>
  To enter a field where I can earn enough to live comfortably with the opportunity to grow, and help people. I would like that to be in the tech field, but at the moment I am definitely already struggling with the course. Interestingly, perhaps, this makes me want to learn as much as I can during this course, and continue with my own learning after. And then, give very basic youtube videos for people who are also struggling.
</p>
<h2>
  A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
</h2>
<p>
  My limitations: it takes a while for me to grasp new ideas, and absorb them. I can get lost in small irrelevant concepts or ideas and then loose track of my focus. Limitations for me are also physical. I have suffered numerous injuries in the past 6 months, and am still experiencing constant chronic back and wrist pain. Although my gp, physio, and rheumatologist are trying to figure this all out with pain medications, tests, and physical therapy, it is another limitation that unexpectedly came up. When it gets very bad, to communicate with facilitators if I am struggling. 
Strengths: I have perseverance, and genuinely try my hardest.
</p>
<h2>
  What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
</h2>
<p>
  Focused and pre-planned discipline. Without plans or accountability I loose track of time.
Priorities to keeping track of time.
Asking for help.
Vulnerability. Letting people know if I am not able to do something and not feel so embarrassed or dumb for it.
To be able to manage workload better. I would like to be a better communicator.
</p>
<h2>
  Demonstrate your commitments as to how you will manage your workload in this programme
</h2>
<p>
  Set alarms for work time when working from home.
Set reminders for work periods when working with others.
Follow the timeline guides TAKE NOTE of where I am struggling, so I can go back and refresh.
Communicate with others where i am at. Ensure healthy habits. Sleep, eat better. Speak-up early when struggling rather than struggling alone. Ask for help.
</p>
<h2>
  How and where you will seek help in a timely way?
</h2>
<p>
  When I am struggling, head to discord chat and look for any answers. Ask my homegroup for help. Ask Jordan or Jared if really stuck. Speak up early, instead of spening too long on other youtube tutorials or websites trying to find an answer. Even if I feel like I am far behind everyone else, still ask, instead of being afraid to do so.

<h2>
  A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
